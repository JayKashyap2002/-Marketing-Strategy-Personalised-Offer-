# Introduction:
This project is based on the publicly available survey data that provides insights into the driver's behavior and preferences regarding dining and takeaway offers. The main objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a user accepting the offer based on their behavior and preferences.

# Data:
The survey data is collected by providing various scenarios to different users. It includes features like income range, age, gender, qualification, etc. The target variable is Offer Accepted, which indicates whether the user accepted the offer or not.

# Approach:
The survey data is analyzed to identify key factors that influence user behavior, including the decision to accept or decline the offer. A Random Forest model is developed to predict the likelihood of offer acceptance. The model achieved an F1 score of 0.68, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting user behavior.

# Conclusion:
This project showcases how machine learning can be applied to understand user behavior and predict their likelihood of accepting an offer. The results can be used by businesses to optimize their marketing strategies and tailor their offers to the preferences of their customers. The code and documentation for this project can be found on the GitHub repository.
